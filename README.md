# genreClassifier

This project attempts to use data available from the <a href="https://github.com/mdeff/fma">Free Music Archive</a> to build a classifier attempting to identify the genre of a specific song. The FMA includes over 100,000 audio files with associated metadata. In this project, we investigate the ability to use the metadata portion of the FMA to assign a genre tag to audio evaluate the resulting classification.

# Project Files

The main notebook detailing the analysis process is available in this repository <a href="https://github.com/ryanmswan/springboard_capstone_1/blob/master/notebooks/1.3-fma_analysis_updated.ipynb">HERE.</a>
